### Online Papers about SWIG

-   **[Perl Extension Building with SWIG](papers/Perl98/swigperl.htm)**.
    This paper, presented at the 1998 O\'Reilly Perl Conference,
    describes the use of SWIG with Perl5 and covers many advanced
    topics. \[ [PDF](papers/Perl98/swigperl.pdf) \].

-   **[Tcl and SWIG as a C/C++ Development
    Tool](papers/Tcl98/TclChap.html)**. Originally written as a draft
    for a book chapter, this paper provides an overview of using Tcl and
    SWIG. It also appears on the CD-ROM accompanying "Tcl/Tk for Real
    Programmers" by Clif Flynt.

-   **[SWIG : An Easy to Use Tool for Integrating Scripting Languages
    with C and C++](papers/Tcl96/tcl96.html)**. While a little dated,
    this is the first SWIG paper. Presented at the 4th Tcl/Tk Workshop,
    Monterey, California, July 6-10, 1996. Also available from
    [USENIX](http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/tcl96/beazley.html).

-   **[Using SWIG to Control, Prototype, and Debug C Programs with
    Python](papers/Py96/python96.html)**. Presented at the 4th
    International Python Conference, Livermore, California, June, 1996.

-   **[Feeding a Large-scale Physics Application to
    Python](papers/Py97/beazley.html)**. Presented at the 6th
    International Python Conference, San Jose, California. October
    14-17, 1997. This paper describes the use of Python/SWIG with a
    high-performance physics application. This application was a
    runner-up in the 1998 Gordon-Bell prize for achieving 10 Gflops
    sustained performance on the
    [Avalon](http://loki-www.lanl.gov/papers/sc98/) Linux Cluster at Los
    Alamos National Laboratory.

### Tutorials about SWIG

-   **[SWIG Masterclass](http://www.dabeaz.com/SwigMaster/index.html)**.
    In this tutorial, the creator of SWIG gives the inside story on what
    SWIG is, how it works, and how it is put together - PyCon March
    2008.

-   **[Interfacing C/C++ and Python with
    SWIG](papers/PyTutorial98/PyTutorial98.pdf)** (PDF). Half-day
    tutorial presented at the 7th International Python Conference,
    November, 1998.

-   **[Interfacing C/C++ and Python with
    SWIG](papers/PyTutorial97/PyTutorial97.pdf)** (PDF). Half-day
    tutorial presented at the 6th International Python Conference,
    October, 1997.

-   **[Tcl Extension Building with
    SWIG](papers/TclTutorial98/TclTutorial98.pdf)** (PDF). Tutorial
    presented at the 1998 Tcl/Tk Conference.

### Other Resources

-   Klaus Kaempf gave an introductory SWIG tutorial in July 2008 as an
    OpenSUSE talk - [Slides
    (pdf)](http://files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/e/eb/Kkaempf_KnowledgeSharing_Swig.pdf).

-   Perl users can find more information about SWIG in the O\'Reilly
    book ["Advanced Perl
    Programming"](http://www.ora.com/catalog/advperl).

-   Daniel Blezek wrote an article about SWIG in the November, 1998
    issue of the Dr Dobb\'s [\'Rapid Prototyping with
    SWIG\'](http://www.drdobbs.com/rapid-prototyping-with-swig/184403568).

-   Scott Bolte wrote an article about SWIG in the Winter, 1997 issue of
    [The Perl Journal](http://www.tpj.com).

-   John Ousterhout\'s [paper](https://www.tcl.tk/doc/scripting.html) on
    scripting languages provides a good overview of the use of scripting
    languages and their relationship to systems programming languages.
    SWIG was developed with many of these issues in mind so this paper
    might be of interest to users who are new to SWIG and its goals.

-   **[Lightweight Computational Steering of Very Large Scale Molecular
    Dynamics
    Simulations](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=369136&CFID=735721914&CFTOKEN=57174172)**
    . Presented at Supercomputing\'96. This paper describes the
    application that motivated the development of SWIG. (See why SWIG
    was originally developed).
